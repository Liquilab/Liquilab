# ⚠️ NOTE: Primary Guidelines Location

The complete **Liquilab Design System Guidelines** are currently located at:

**`/guidelines/Guidelines.md`**

This is the **Single Source of Truth (SSoT)** for the entire Design System, including:
- Complete color palette (Electric Blue, Signal Aqua, semantic colors)
- Typography system (Manrope, tabular numerals)
- Component specifications (RangeBand™, KPI cards, tables, charts)
- Page layouts (Portfolio Premium/Pro, Pool Pro/Universe)
- Strategy C numeric clarity rules
- Premium vs Pro differentiation
- "No advice" framing rules

## Quick Reference

For the complete, up-to-date Design System documentation, **always refer to** `/guidelines/Guidelines.md`.

This `/figma/` directory contains supplementary documentation:
- `FIGMA_MAKE_DS_SUMMARY_SPEC.md` - Detailed DS summary frame spec
- `RANGEBAND_UNIFICATION.md` - RangeBand™ unified spec
- `DS_CONSISTENCY_AUDIT.md` - DS audit and resolutions
- `HANDOVER_DESIGN_SYSTEM_SSOT.md` - High-level DS handover
- `IMPLEMENTATION_ROUTES.md` - Figma ⇄ code mappings

## Future Consolidation

In a future update, the contents of `/guidelines/Guidelines.md` may be migrated into this `/figma/` directory to consolidate all Design System documentation in one location.

---

**For now: Use `/guidelines/Guidelines.md` as your primary DS reference.**
